craigslist_notify
=================

If you're searching on craigslist for a apartment in San Francisco, or any
other sought-after item, this script can give you an edge.  It polls a
craigslist RSS feed URL (which is linked at the bottom of craigslist search
and listing pages) and emails you when new postings are found.
If you're crafty, you can have emails sent to your cell carrier's
[SMS gateway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_SMS_gateways) to receive
a text message for each posting.
